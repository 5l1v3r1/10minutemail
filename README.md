__Temporary Email - 10minutemail.net__

10minutemail.net is a free, disposable e-mail service. Your temporary e-mail address will expire after 10 minutes, after which you cannot access it. You can extend the time by 10 minutes.
The website you are registering with could be selling your personal information; you never know where your e-mail will be published. An email address with a 10 minute lifespan is the best solution to prevent this.
